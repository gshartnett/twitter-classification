For terms of service reasons, Sanders Analytics wasn't able to provide the tweets directly, so they provided instead a CSV file with the tweet id's and the sentiment (which was hand-labelled), as well as a python script to automatically download the tweets without authentication. This was in 2011 when such a thing was possible, now one must be authenticated. Therefore I'll have to write my own downloader script.
