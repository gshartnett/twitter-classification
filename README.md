# twitterclassification

This project implements sentiment analysis for tweets, using distant supervision to automatically gather a large training set of labelled tweets. Tweets are classified as positive/neutral/negative, with the positive/neutral training data gathered by querying Twitter's API for tweets containing emoticons. Neutral tweets are gathered from a large collection of official twitter feeds that are reliably dispassionate and neutral.

In order for this code to be used on another computer, an appropriate directory structure for the data will have to be set up. I didn't want/am not able to upload the raw twitter data I have already downloaded, for reasons of size and Terms of Service.
