# twitterclassification

This is a project that implements sentiment analysis for tweets, using distant supervision to automatically gather a large training set of labelled tweets. 

In order for this code to be used on another computer, an appropriate directory structure for the data will have to be set up. I didn't want/am not able to upload the raw twitter data I have already downloaded, for reasons of size and Terms of Service.
